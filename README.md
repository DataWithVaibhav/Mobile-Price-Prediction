📱 Mobile Price Prediction

Mobile Price Prediction is a Machine Learning Web Application that predicts smartphone prices based on their specifications.

Users can input details such as RAM, storage, battery capacity, brand, and processor type, and the system will provide an estimated price.

This project combines Machine Learning (for prediction) with a Flask backend and a modern web frontend to deliver an interactive and user-friendly experience.

🚀 Features
